## Synopsis

An ipython notebook that demonstrates clustering on wine with data scraped from a large wine retailer: K-means, DBSCAN, topic models (use nbviewer to see wordclouds: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WittyAgnomen/WineClustering/blob/master/WineClustering.ipynb) 


## Motivation

Wine is known to have eleaborate descriptions. This project looks to see if those descriptions can traslate in effectively catergorizing along with a few other features.
